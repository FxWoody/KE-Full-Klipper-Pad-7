Some MACROS might not work on your setup if you are running on the NebulaPAD ROOTED since it uses a DIRTY-KLIPPER version that is missing important files for BEACON to install

[LINK TO MY YOUTUBE ON HOW IT RUNS](https://youtu.be/mpI4NBXCfaI?si=CKlKJCg9Sx1YLDBo)

## First Step: Install BEACON in SSH
```cd ~
git clone https://github.com/beacon3d/beacon_klipper.git
./beacon_klipper/install.sh
```

## Print up the support and install on your machine
>Remove the BlTouch and install the BEACON support using the same screws

>Run USB cable along the MAIN ribbon cable and connect to your Pad7
